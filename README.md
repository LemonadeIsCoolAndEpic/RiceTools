**RiceTools** is a simple **linux** terminal application. **RiceTools** can help *store/bookmark* different *commands/applications* to allow for easy access via a simple menu. It can also be easily customized via the config file in 

    ~/.config/ricetools/ricetools.config
**RiceTools** is still in **early development** as just a simple utility but more features are planned such as:

 - Easy Installation
 - Color Customization for each option
 - Better Theming & Stylisation
 - And more!

# Installation
This section will come soon when installation is made significantly easier. For the meantime you will have to build from source
but I'm currently working on a easy way to install this via a package manager like yay.

# Customization
Customising RiceTools is really simple. If you havent ran **RiceTools** yet, **RiceTools** will generate a config file for you. Simply go to the directory

    ~/.config/ricetools/ricetools.config
Open the ricetools.config file in your favourite text editor. The current format is

    name (of the option in the menu), command (that will be run when selected)
This format is likely to be expanded on in the future for additional features but the base will remain the same.
